What is OpenFOAM ?
------------------

- OpenFOAM® (for “Open-source Field Operation And Manipulation”) is an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solve released and developed primarily by OpenCFD Ltd since 2004. 

- It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organizations. 

- OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics.

Which version to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It depends on the features you want to use

    - Check the website and release notes to see which one fits better to your framework
    - If both include the features you need, do some performance and accuracy benchmarks to see which one is better
    - Otherwise it is just matter of taste!

We will be using the OpenCFD Ltd version with vXXXXXX for the training
