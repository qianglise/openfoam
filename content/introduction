What is OpenFOAM ?
------------------

- OpenFOAM is an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solve released and developed primarily by OpenCFD Ltd since 2004. 

- It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organizations. 

- OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics. 

- There are two main branches of OpenFOAM, 

  - one is from OpenFOAM Foundation (`www.openfoam.org <http://www.openfoam.org>`_),
  - and the other is OpenCFD Ltd (`www.openfoam.com <http://www.openfoam.com>`_).
  - In this guide, we only consider the later

-  Extensive guides, tutorials, code samples and documentation on the OpenFOAM
   can be found at `www.openfoam.com <http://www.openfoam.com>`_.

Which version to use?
---------------------

It depends on the features you want to use

    - Check the website and release notes to see which one fits better to your framework
    - If both include the features you need, do some performance and accuracy benchmarks to see which one is better
    - Otherwise it is just matter of taste!

We will be using vXXXXXX for the training
